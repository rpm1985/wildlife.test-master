Wildlife is an app aimed to make identifying local wildlife easier. The app is to be able to record sightings of species on a GPS located map of Cardiff.

# New Features!

  - Creation of Account and logging in
  - Identify certain bird species via a series of dropdown options
  - Pinpoint exactly where the nearest Nature Reserves are in the local area
  - Observe a list of local Nature Reserves


You can also:
  - Click on the Nature Reserves within the list to redirect you to the place it is on the map#
  - Personalise the application by creating an account
  

> The world is becoming increasingly urbanised and this is leading to an increased lack of interest in wildlife and a reduction in the time people spend outdoors in greenspaces.

### Apsirations

In order to fully complete the aim of the product the app will have to inclued:

* Inclusion of a map function for locating and recording species
* Connectivity with other users
* Simple species identification feature with good quality photographs
* Interesting information on species
* A search feature for known species without having to use the identification feature every time
* Ability to use sound to help in the identification
* Intuitive navigation of the app
* Inclusion of a wide range of species


There are still some major known issuse that are in the application that we wish to fix as soon as possible.
### Key Issues
* When the login and register buttons are clicked on the home, the application stops responding. However the login and register pages themeselves work correctly.
* When selecting options for the bird identifier, you cannot go back one step, you have to start again.
* The nature reserves list is not based on you location, it is purely a list of nature reserves.
